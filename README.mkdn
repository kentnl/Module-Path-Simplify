# NAME

Module::Path::Simplify - Simplify absolute paths for pretty-printing.

# VERSION

version 0.001000

# DESCRIPTION

This module aids in simplifying paths to modules you may already have had lying around,
for instance, like in `%INC`, and aids in compressing them into a format more easily skimmed,
for use in diagnostic reporting such as stack-traces, where legibility of the trace is more important
to you than being able to use path `URIs` verbatim.

# USAGE

    use Module::Path::Simplify;

    my $simplifier = Module::Path::Simplify->new();

    print $simplifier->simplify( $INC{'Module/Path/Simplify.pm'} )
      # This may output something like $INC[0]/Module/Path/Simplify.pm
      # or even ${VP} or ${SP}, depending on where you installed it.

    print $simplifier->pp_aliases;
      # This will emit a key => value table of all the aliases used so far
      # by this instance, expanding the display setting of the alias to the path matched.
      #
      # In cases where the aliases are different to their display values for better compressability
      # the raw internal alias names will be displayed in parentheses at the end of the line.

# METHODS

## `new`

Create a `simplifier` object.

Normally, `new` captures the state of `@INC` at its creation time.

This can be disabled to use a per-resolution dynamic `@INC` via

    ->new( inc_dynamic => 1 );

Additionally, `@INC` can be overridden with a custom list via

    ->new( inc => [ @INC ] );

[`inc_dynamic`](#inc_dynamic) and [`inc`](#inc) don't work together, and setting `inc_dynamic`
will cause `inc` to be ignored.

## `simplify`

Return a simplified version of a path, or the path itself
if there are no simplifications available

    print $simpl->simplify( $INC{'Test/More.pm'} )

## `aliases`

Returns the internal alias tracking object.

## `pp_aliases`

Return a string detailing the used simplification aliases
and where they map to. ( And possibly their internal identifier )

## `inc_dynamic`

Returns whether or not this simplifier is using a dynamic `@INC`.

## `inc`

Returns the snapshot `@INC` in use when not using `inc_dynamic`
