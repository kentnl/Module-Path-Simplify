Module::Path::Simplify

This module aids in simplifying paths to modules you may already have
had lying around, for instance, like in %INC, and aids in compressing
them into a format more easily skimmed, for use in diagnostic reporting
such as stack-traces, where legibility of the trace is more important to
you than being able to use path "URIs" verbatim.
